# Classes-and-Privacy-Leaks
Project from CSS 143 UWB course

I built three classes (Money, Date and Bill) for use in managing a set of outstanding and paid bills.
I have posted these three classes and a test driver (4 files total) that exercises all functionality for these
classes. I explored class composition, overloading, accessors/mutators, privacy leaks, toString(), and
equals().
